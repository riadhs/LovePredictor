**Project Idea**: 
The inspiration for this project came from Valentine’s Day, when many people exchange text messages with one another. 
Often, we may wonder how romantic a message is compared to others—without actually reading through every single text.
This application addresses that curiosity by analyzing the content of a message and providing a response that indicates how romantic the text is.
